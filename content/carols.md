# JOY TO THE WORLD
Joy to the world the Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare Him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing  
  
Joy to the world the Saviour reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods  
Rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy  
  
He rules the world with truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders and wonders of His love  

# DECK THE HALLS

# MISTLETOE AND WINE
A child is King, the caroller sing  
The old is past, there’s a new beginning  
Dreams of Santa, dreams of snow  
Fingers numb and faces aglow  
  
It’s Christmas time, mistletoe and wine  
Children singing Christian rhyme  
With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree  
A time to rejoice in the good that we see  
  
A time for living, a time for believing  
A time for trusting, not deceiving  
Love and laughter and life ever after  
Ours for the taking, just follow the master  
  
It’s a time for giving, a time for getting  
A time for forgiving and for forgetting  
Christmas is love, Christmas is peace  
A time for hating and fighting to cease  

# MARY'S BOY CHILD
Long time ago in Bethlehem  
So the Holy bible say  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas day  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A King was born today  
And man shall live forever more  
Because of Christmas day  
  
While shepherds watched their flocks by night  
They see a bright new shining star  
They hear a choir sing a song  
The music seems to come from afar  
  
For a moment the world was aglow  
All the bells rang out  
There were tears of joy and laughter  
People shouting let everyone know  
There is hope for all to find peace  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A King was born today  
And man shall live forever more  
Because of Christmas day  
  
Now Joseph and his wife Mary  
Came to Bethlehem that night  
They found no place to bear their child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
And then they found a little nook  
In the stable all forlorn  
Then in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little boy was born  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A King was born today  
And man shall live forever more  
Because of Christmas day  
  
Oh my Lord, you sent your Son to save us  
Oh my Lord, your very self You gave us  
Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us  
And love may reign once more  
  
Oh my Lord, there in the crib they found Him  
Oh my Lord, a golden halo 'round Him  
Oh my Lord, they gathered all around Him  
To see and adore  

# DRUMMER BOY
Come they told me pa ra pa pam pam  
A new born king to see pa ra pa pam pam  
Our highest gifts we bring pa ra pa pam pam  
To lay before a king pa ra pa pam pam  
So to honour him pa ra pa pam pam  
When we come  
  
Baby Jesus pa ra pa pam pam  
I am a poor boy too pa ra pa pam pam  
I have no gifts to bring pa ra pa pam pam  
That's fit to give a king pa ra pa pam pam  
I shall play for you pa ra pa pam pam  
On my drum  
  
Mary nodded pa ra pa pam pam  
The ox and lamb kept time pa ra pa pam pam  
I played my drum for him pa ra pa pam pam  
I played my best for him pa ra pa pam pam  
Then he smiled at me pa ra pa pam pam  
Me and my drum  

# RUDOLPH
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer  
Had a very shiny nose  
And if you ever saw it  
You would even say it glows  
All of the other reindeer  
Used to laugh and call him names  
They never let poor Rudolph  
Join in any reindeer games  
  
Then one foggy Christmas eve  
Santa came to say  
Rudolph with your nose so bright  
Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight  
Then how the reindeer loved him  
As they shouted out with glee  
Rudolph the red nose reindeer  
You’ll go down in history  

# JINGLE BELLS
Dashing through the snow  
On a one horse open sleigh  
Over fields we go, laughing all the way  
Bells on bob tails ring, making spirits bright  
What fun it is to ride and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride,  
On a one horse open sleigh  

# AWAY IN A MANGER
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head  
The stars in the bright sky  
Looked down where He lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing the baby awakes  
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes  
I love thee Lord Jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever and love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care  
And fit us for heaven to live with thee there  

# HARK THE HERALD ANGELS SING
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new-born King  
Peace on earth and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled  
Joyful all ye nations rise  
Join the triumph in the skies  
With angelic host proclaim  
Christ is born in Bethlehem  
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
  
Christ by highest heaven adored  
Christ the Everlasting Lord  
Late in time behold him come  
Offspring of a virgin’s womb  
Veiled in flesh the godhead see  
Hail the incarnate deity  
Pleased as man with man to dwell  
Jesus our Emmanuel  
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new-born King  
  
Hail the heaven born Prince of Peace  
Hail the Son of Righteousness  
Light and life to all He brings  
Risen with healing in His wings  
Mild He lays His glory by  
Born that man no more to die  
Born to raise the sons of earth  
Born to give them second birth  
Hark the herald angels sing  
Glory to the new-born king  

# THE FIRST NOEL
The first noel the angel did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay  
In fields where they lay, keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter’s night that was so deep  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
And by the light of that same star  
Three wise men came from country afar  
To seek for a king was their intent  
And to follow the star wherever it went  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
This star drew nigh to the northwest  
O’er Bethlehem it took its rest  
And there it did both stop and stay  
Right over the place where Jesus lay  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
Then entered in those wise men three  
Fall reverently upon their knee  
And offered there in his presence  
Their gold and myrrh and frankincense  

# WHEN A CHILD IS BORN
A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights a way up high  
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You’ve got to feel, you’re on solid ground  
For a spell or two, no-one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
It’s all a dream, an illusion now  
It must come true, sometime soon somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  

# OH COME ALL YE FAITHFUL
Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant  
Oh come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold him, born the King of Angels  
  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation  
Oh sing all ye citizens of heaven above  
Glory to God in the highest  
  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  
  
Yea, Lord we greet the, born this happy morning  
Jesus to thee be all glory given  
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing  
  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Oh come let us adore him  
Christ the Lord  

# SILENT NIGHT
Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
‘round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing hallelujah  
Christ the Saviour is born  
Christ the Saviour is born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Son of God, love’s pure light  
Radiant beams from Thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus Lord at thy birth  
Jesus Lord at thy birth
