<h2>MISTLETOE AND WINE</h2>
<p>A child is King, the caroller sing</p>
<p>The old is past, there’s a new beginning</p>
<p>Dreams of Santa, dreams of snow</p>
<p>Fingers numb and faces aglow</p>
<br>
<p>It’s Christmas time, mistletoe and wine</p>
<p>Children singing Christian rhyme</p>
<p>With logs on the fire and gifts on the tree</p>
<p>A time to rejoice in the good that we see</p>

<p>A time for living, a time for believing</p>
<p>A time for trusting, not deceiving</p>
<p>Love and laughter and life ever after</p>
<p>Ours for the taking, just follow the master</p>
<br>
<p>It’s a time for giving, a time for getting</p>
<p>A time for forgiving and for forgetting</p>
<p>Christmas is love, Christmas is peace</p>
<p>A time for hating and fighting to cease</p>

<h2>MARY'S BOY CHILD</h2>
<p>Long time ago in Bethlehem</p>
<p>So the Holy bible say</p>
<p>Mary's boy child Jesus Christ</p>
<p>Was born on Christmas day</p>
<br>
<p>Hark now hear the angels sing</p>
<p>A King was born today</p>
<p>And man shall live forever more</p>
<p>Because of Christmas day</p>
<br>
<p>While shepherds watched their flocks by night</p>
<p>They see a bright new shining star</p>
<p>They hear a choir sing a song</p>
<p>The music seems to come from afar</p>
<br>
<p>For a moment the world was aglow</p>
<p>All the bells rang out</p>
<p>There were tears of joy and laughter</p>
<p>People shouting let everyone know</p>
<p>There is hope for all to find peace</p>
<br>
<p>Hark now hear the angels sing</p>
<p>A King was born today</p>
<p>And man shall live forever more</p>
<p>Because of Christmas day</p>
<br>
<p>Now Joseph and his wife Mary</p>
<p>Came to Bethlehem that night</p>
<p>They found no place to bear their child</p>
<p>Not a single room was in sight</p>
<br>
<p>And then they found a little nook</p>
<p>In the stable all forlorn</p>
<p>Then in a manger cold and dark</p>
<p>Mary's little boy was born</p>
<br>
<p>Hark now hear the angels sing</p>
<p>A King was born today</p>
<p>And man shall live forever more</p>
<p>Because of Christmas day</p>
<br>
<p>Oh my Lord, you sent your Son to save us</p>
<p>Oh my Lord, your very self You gave us</p>
<p>Oh my Lord, that sin may not enslave us</p>
<p>And love may reign once more</p>
<br>
<p>Oh my Lord, there in the crib they found Him</p>
<p>Oh my Lord, a golden halo 'round Him</p>
<p>Oh my Lord, they gathered all around Him</p>
<p>To see and adore</p>

<h2>DRUMMER BOY</h2>
<p>Come they told me pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>A new born king to see pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>Our highest gifts we bring pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>To lay before a king pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>So to honour him pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>When we come</p>
<br>
<p>Baby Jesus pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>I am a poor boy too pa ra pa pam pam</p>

<p>That's fit to give a king pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>I shall play for you pa ra pa pam pam</p>
<p>On my drum</p>

<h2>RUDOLPH</h2>
<p>Rudolph the red nosed reindeer</p>
<p>Had a very shiny nose</p>
<p>And if you ever saw it</p>
<p>You would even say it glows</p>
<p>All of the other reindeer</p>
<p>Used to laugh and call him names</p>
<p>They never let poor Rudolph</p>
<p>Join in any reindeer games</p>
<br>
<p>Then one foggy Christmas eve</p>
<p>Santa came to say</p>
<p>Rudolph with your nose so bright</p>
<p>Won’t you guide my sleigh tonight</p>
<p>Then how the reindeer loved him</p>
<p>As they shouted out with glee</p>
<p>Rudolph the red nose reindeer</p>
<p>You’ll go down in history</p>

<h2>JINGLE BELLS</h2>
<p>Dashing through the snow</p>
<p>On a one horse open sleigh</p>
<p>Over fields we go, laughing all the way</p>
<p>Bells on bob tails ring, making spirits bright</p>
<p>What fun it is to ride and sing</p>
<p>A sleighing song tonight</p>
<br>
<p>Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way</p>
<p>Oh what fun it is to ride,</p>
<p>On a one horse open sleigh</p>

<h2>AWAY IN A MANGER</h2>
<p>Away in a manger, no crib for a bed</p>
<p>The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head</p>
<p>The stars in the bright sky</p>
<p>Looked down where He lay</p>
<p>The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay</p>
<br>
<p>The cattle are lowing the baby awakes</p>
<p>But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes</p>
<p>I love thee Lord Jesus, look down from the sky</p>
<p>And stay by my cradle 'til morning is nigh</p>
<br>
<p>Be near me Lord Jesus, I ask thee to stay</p>
<p>Close by me forever and love me I pray</p>
<p>Bless all the dear children in thy tender care</p>
<p>And fit us for heaven to live with thee there</p>

<h2>HARK THE HERALD ANGELS SING</h2>
<p>Hark the herald angels sing</p>
<p>Glory to the new-born King</p>

<p>Join the triumph in the skies</p>
<p>With angelic host proclaim</p>

<p>Born to raise the sons of earth</p>
<p>Born to give them second birth</p>
<p>Hark the herald angels sing</p>
<p>Glory to the new-born king</p>

<h2>THE FIRST NOEL</h2>
<p>The first noel the angel did say</p>
<p>Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay</p>
<p>In fields where they lay, keeping their sheep</p>
<p>On a cold winter’s night that was so deep</p>
<br>
<p>Noel, noel, noel, noel</p>
<p>Born is the king of Israel</p>
<br>
<p>And by the light of that same star</p>
<p>Three wise men came from country afar</p>
<p>To seek for a king was their intent</p>
<p>And to follow the star wherever it went</p>
<br>
<p>Noel, noel, noel, noel</p>
<p>Born is the king of Israel</p>
<br>
<p>This star drew nigh to the northwest</p>
<p>O’er Bethlehem it took its rest</p>
<p>And there it did both stop and stay</p>
<p>Right over the place where Jesus lay</p>
<br>
<p>Noel, noel, noel, noel</p>
<p>Born is the king of Israel</p>
<br>
<p>Then entered in those wise men three</p>
<p>Fall reverently upon their knee</p>
<p>And offered there in his presence</p>
<p>Their gold and myrrh and frankincense</p>

<h2>WHEN A CHILD IS BORN</h2>
<p>A ray of hope flickers in the sky</p>
<p>A tiny star lights a way up high</p>
<p>All across the land, dawns a brand new morn</p>
<p>This comes to pass when a child is born</p>
<br>
<p>A silent wish sails the seven seas</p>
<p>The winds of change whisper in the trees</p>
<p>And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn</p>
<p>This comes to pass when a child is born</p>
<br>
<p>A rosy hue settles all around</p>
<p>You’ve got to feel, you’re on solid ground</p>
<p>For a spell or two, no-one seems forlorn</p>
<p>This comes to pass, when a child is born</p>
<br>
<p>It’s all a dream, an illusion now</p>
<p>It must come true, sometime soon somehow</p>
<p>All across the land dawns a brand new morn</p>
<p>This comes to pass when a child is born</p>

<h2>OH COME ALL YE FAITHFUL</h2>
<p>Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant</p>
<p>Oh come ye, oh come ye to Bethlehem</p>

<p>Oh come let us adore him</p>
<p>Oh come let us adore him</p>
<p>Christ the Lord</p>
<br>
<p>Sing choirs of angels, sing in exultation</p>
<p>Oh sing all ye citizens of heaven above</p>
<p>Glory to God in the highest</p>
<br>
<p>Oh come let us adore him</p>
<p>Oh come let us adore him</p>
<p>Oh come let us adore him</p>
<p>Christ the Lord</p>
<br>
