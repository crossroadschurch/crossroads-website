Hi, welcome to Crossroads

[![welcome to crossroads](/images/atchurch.jpg "Pastors Charles and Bev")](<>)

Hi, we are Charles & Bev, and together we lead Crossroads in Burghfield Common. We were ordained in 1998 by Church of the Nations International in South Africa. We arrived in the UK in 2010 and ministered with Keith Dolding at the Well Church and remain part of Churches in Community. Crossroads is a church that strongly supports community projects.

## Ministries

We have weekly Sunday services and a Tuesday Bible Study meeting where we encourage personal ministry.

We serve and minister in a variety of ways, and believe that the most important mission field is the one on our doorstep:

## Christian Services

Our services are geared towards meeting with God and with one another. We focus on worship, teaching and ministry coupled with fellowship and community. Children are welcome.

## Community outreach:

Charles and Bev are active members of Christians Together in Mission, (TiM) with Charles holding the position of Chairman.

Previously Charles was the project developer for Whitley SALT (Social Action Linked Together) combining the services and activities of several Christian charities and churches under a single umbrella.

## Befriending

Bev has been the coordinator for TiM Friends since 2013, a befriending service which reaches out to elderly and isolated people in Burghfield, Mortimer, Sulhamstead, Ufton Nervet and beyond.

We are involved in community outreach programmes including supporting the Ukrainian families.

## Mental health

Charles is a registered Psychodynamic Counsellor and EDMR Therapist. He is a counsellor and group facilitator at Still the Hunger; a Christian mental health recovery programme. 

## Times of Meetings

We meet at various places during the week:

* Sundays @ 10:00 to 11:30 am at [Burghfield Village Hall, Recreation Road, RG7 3EN](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Burghfield+Village+Hall/@51.3958813,-1.0655423,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x48769eed13a17357:0xdf581b330e7e5902!8m2!3d51.3958813!4d-1.0642548!16s%2Fg%2F11b67nj_m_)
